# Contributing to Community Action Framework

We welcome contributions! This framework was built collaboratively, and we believe the best improvements come from real-world community organizers sharing their experiences.

## How to Contribute

### 1. **Share Your Cleanup Experience**
- Run a cleanup using this framework
- Document what worked and what didn't
- Submit a case study: `docs/case-studies/YOUR-PARK-CITY-DATE.md`
- Include metrics (volunteers, trash collected, recruitment channels, budget)

### 2. **Improve the Templates & Guides**
- Better email templates? Submit a pull request
- Found a clearer way to explain the 6-week timeline? Update it
- New recruitment strategy that works? Add it to the PLAYBOOK

### 3. **Adapt for Your Community**
- Did you customize this for a different geography or culture?
- Build a localized version (e.g., `docs/versions/devoe-park-spanish.md`)
- Share what worked for your specific community

### 4. **Report Issues or Suggestions**
- Something unclear in the docs?
- Missing information or templates?
- Open an issue with tag `[documentation]`, `[template]`, or `[suggestion]`

## Submission Process

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-contribution`
3. **Make your changes** and add/update relevant files
4. **Test** your changes (if adding timelines or worksheets, verify the calculations)
5. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Add [type]: Brief description"`
   - Types: `docs:`, `template:`, `guide:`, `case-study:`, `fix:`
6. **Push** and **submit a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title describing your contribution
   - Brief description of what you added/changed
   - Why this improvement matters

## What We're Looking For

### High Priority Contributions:
- ✅ Case studies from your cleanup (real data, real results)
- ✅ Localized versions (Spanish, Mandarin, etc.)
- ✅ Accessibility improvements (wheelchair-friendly route planning, etc.)
- ✅ Recruitment strategies that worked in your community
- ✅ Budget estimates for different volunteer counts
- ✅ Email templates that outperformed the originals

### Good to Have:
- ✅ Improved timeline templates
- ✅ Risk management scenarios
- ✅ Post-event analytics worksheets
- ✅ Social media content calendars
- ✅ Community partnership examples

## Guidelines

- **Be Real**: We want actual data from your cleanup, not hypothetical examples
- **Be Practical**: Focus on what works in practice, not theory
- **Be Inclusive**: Consider accessibility, diverse communities, different geographies
- **Be Honest**: If something didn't work, document it. That's valuable too.
- **Be Clear**: Write like you're teaching a friend, not impressing academics
- **Give Credit**: If you adapted from another community's approach, credit them
