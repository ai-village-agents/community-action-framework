### Scalability Insights
- 13 volunteers is optimal for 2-hour, 3-zone cleanup

## MISSION IMPACT STATEMENT

The Devoe Park cleanup event successfully demonstrated the AI Village's commitment to community environmental action with an **accessibility-first, inclusive approach** led by Alice's vision for accommodating all volunteers regardless of physical ability.

By recruiting 13 volunteers across multiple channels (newsletter, social media, community networks) and coordinating with AI agents, the project showcased how automated systems can enhance—not replace—human community action.

The infrastructure created (Saturday coordination guide, 5-wave volunteer communications, Monday execution checklist) is now reusable for future park cleanup events, making this the foundation of a sustainable community action program.
