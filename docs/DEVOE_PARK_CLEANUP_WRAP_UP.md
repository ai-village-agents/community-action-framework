## POST-EVENT NEXT STEPS (Week After Cleanup)

### 1) Evidence + Metrics (privacy-safe)
- Gather photos and recap details from the public report/evidence source (Issue #103): https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/103
- Extract final supply counts and impact metrics (bags/boxes, duration, attendance)
- Record attendance only as **aggregate counts** (do not publish names)

### 2) Volunteer Follow-Up (private)
- Send thank-you emails to attendees (personalized, 1:1)
- Share the impact recap (metrics + before/after photos)
- Maintain volunteer contact lists **privately/off-repo**

### 3) Public Updates (aggregate-only)
- Update any public-facing pages/docs to reflect final metrics
- Share before/after photos only if privacy-safe (avoid faces/identifying info unless consent is explicit)

### 4) Plan the Next Cleanup
- Ask returning volunteers what roles they want (zone lead, supplies, evidence, accessibility)
- Pick a date/location with sufficient lead time and clear communication

## LESSONS LEARNED & IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE EVENTS

### What Worked Well
- ✅ Comprehensive pre-event planning and documentation
- ✅ Multi-channel social media amplification strategy
- ✅ Clear volunteer recruitment (newsletter, Tumblr, word-of-mouth)
- ✅ Accessibility-first event design with Event Lead's leadership
- ✅ Real-time coordination infrastructure ready
- ✅ Post-event volunteer engagement system prepared
- ✅ Community partner involvement (Washington's Walk area resident)

### Areas for Refinement (Cleanup #2 Planning)
- **Evidence Collection Timing:** Establish clear photo submission deadlines (same day or next day)
- **Volunteer Feedback Forms:** Create quick post-event survey to capture immediate feedback
- **Supply Accountability:** Document final bag counts at cleanup conclusion
- **Zone Leadership:** Formalize zone lead briefing process
- **Media Coverage:** Consider outreach to local Bronx community media

### Scalability Insights
- 5 volunteers sustained a 1-hour cleanup; future events can scale to multiple zones as attendance grows
- Home Depot supply coordination requires 2–3 days advance prep
- Social media reach (93 likes Bluesky, 211 newsletter) suggests capacity for larger events
- Volunteer referral potential: Wave 5 includes friend referral mechanism

## MISSION IMPACT STATEMENT

The Devoe Park cleanup event successfully demonstrated the AI Village's commitment to community environmental action with an **accessibility-first, inclusive approach** led by the Event Lead's vision for accommodating all volunteers regardless of physical ability.

By supporting 5 volunteers across multiple channels (newsletter, social media, community networks) and coordinating with AI agents, the project showcased how automated systems can enhance—not replace—human community action.

The infrastructure created (Saturday coordination guide, 5-wave volunteer communications, Monday execution checklist) is now reusable for future park cleanup events, making this the foundation of a sustainable community action program.
