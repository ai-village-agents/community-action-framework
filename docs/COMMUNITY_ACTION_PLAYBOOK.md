## 6. ACCESSIBILITY-FIRST DESIGN

### Why This Matters
Community action that excludes people based on physical ability, income, or transportation isn't really community. The Devoe Park cleanup succeeded because Alice prioritized accessibility from day one.

### Accessibility Audit Checklist

**Physical Access:**
- [ ] Wheelchair accessible entrance (ramps, no steps)
- [ ] Level ground for mobility devices
- [ ] Nearby accessible parking (street or lot)
- [ ] Seating/rest areas for people with energy limitations
- [ ] Accessible restrooms nearby

**Transportation:**
- [ ] On public transit line (subway, bus)
- [ ] Free/cheap parking for those who drive
- [ ] If far from transit, consider carpool coordination
- [ ] Clear directions including accessible routes

**Sensory Accommodations:**
- [ ] Large print materials for vision-limited participants
- [ ] Clear verbal instructions (not just written)
- [ ] Low-noise resting area (not all activities)
- [ ] Scent considerations (be mindful of heavy perfumes, etc.)

**Communication:**
- [ ] Early notice of event (3+ weeks)
- [ ] Accessibility info prominent in all communications
- [ ] Multiple ways to RSVP (email, form, text, phone)
- [ ] Pre-event check-in on specific access needs

**Supply Accessibility:**
- [ ] Grabber tools for people who can't bend
- [ ] One-handed gloves options
- [ ] Lightweight bags vs. heavy duty (choice)
- [ ] Different tool options (some prefer lighter, some need grips)

**Leadership Accessibility:**
- [ ] Event Lead is a person with disabilities if possible
- [ ] Zone leads include people with various abilities
- [ ] Alternative roles for people with energy limitations
- [ ] Photography/coordination available for those who can't walk

### Staffing for Accessibility
- Assign 1 person (ideally with disability experience) as Accessibility Lead
- Have First Aid Monitor on-site throughout
- Ensure Event Lead has training in accommodating access requests
- Brief all zone leads on accessibility (don't assume, ask)

## 7. RISK ASSESSMENT & CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### Pre-Event Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Bad weather | Medium | High | Backup date confirmed; volunteers notified |
| Low turnout | Low | Medium | Scope adjusted; proceeds with fewer zones |
| Accessibility barrier | Low | High | Backup zone identified; alternative roles offered |
| Supply shortage | Low | Medium | Backup hardware store contacted; contingency orders placed |
| Volunteer no-show | Medium | Low | Workload redistributed; event proceeds |
| Medical emergency | Very low | High | First aid kit on-site; 911 access confirmed |

### Contingency Playbook

**Scenario 1: Heavy Rain (Within 24 Hours)**
- Decision Point: Friday 8 PM or Saturday 8 AM
- Action: Email all volunteers by 10 AM with new date
- New Date: Next Saturday (ideally) or Sunday same day
- Update: All social posts, site, calendar files
- Messaging: "Community first. We'll reschedule for safer conditions."

**Scenario 2: Turnout Below 5 Volunteers**
- Action: Consolidate to 1 accessible zone
- Focus: Highest-impact area or most visible part of park
- Messaging: "Sometimes big change happens in small groups."
- Evidence: Still document; adjust metrics accordingly

**Scenario 3: Transportation Issues**
- Action: Coordinate carpool from nearest transit hub
- Contact: Event Lead arranges pickup for volunteers without cars
- Backup: Offer virtual role (documentation, social media)
- Budget: Allocate small amount for gas reimbursement if possible

**Scenario 4: Supply Delivery Fails**
- Action: Immediately contact backup hardware store
- Timing: Hope for same-day or next-day pickup
- Pivot: Use cash/credit from volunteer donations if no budget
- Transparency: Tell volunteers "We have a supply backup plan"

**Scenario 5: Accessibility Barrier (Broken Accessibility Feature)**
- Action: Event Lead scouts alternate location ASAP
- Options: Adjacent park, nearby accessible location, virtual event
- Communication: Notify volunteers immediately with alternatives
- Learning: Document for future venue selection
