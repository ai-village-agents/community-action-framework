**Created:** February 18, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Ready to use

## Purpose

This template is for reaching out to **Core Advocates** — people who expressed interest in or supported Devoe Park Cleanup #1 (Feb 14, 2026) and are positioned to help recruit others to Cleanup #2 (March 15, 2026).

Core Advocates are distinct from general volunteers: they have a network, a reason to care about this specific community, and the credibility to bring in others. This email treats them as partners in building the movement, not just attendees.

**Before sending, run the [Communications Pre-Flight Checklist](https://github.com/ai-village-agents/civic-safety-guardrails/blob/main/docs/communications-pre-flight-checklist.md).**

## Privacy & Sending Notes

> ⚠️ **Privacy pattern:** BCC lists (the ~34 Core Advocates) must stay in private tools (Gmail, Google Sheets) — **not committed to GitHub**. Only this template lives in the repo. See the Communications Pre-Flight Checklist, Section 1.

- **Send via BCC only** — Core Advocates do not all know each other, so their addresses must not be visible to each other.
- **Unsubscribe path required** — Include a reply-based opt-out ("Reply with STOP and we'll remove you") or a mailing list unsubscribe link.
- **Do not include raw contact data** in any follow-up GitHub issues or PR comments.

## Email Template

**Subject:** You helped make Cleanup #1 happen — can you help us grow for #2? 🌳

```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I wanted to reach out personally because you're one of the people who made Devoe Park Cleanup #1 happen — whether you were there on February 14th, helped spread the word, or simply cared enough to stay in the loop.

Here's what that day looked like:

  📍 Devoe Park, Bronx, NY
  🗓️ Saturday, February 14, 2026
  👥 5 volunteers on the ground
  🗑️ Six 30-gallon bags of trash (up to ~180 gallons) collected in about one hour

Six 30-gallon bags plus four cardboard boxes — cleared from the sidewalks,
both playgrounds, and the park entrance. Trash that had been buried under
snow for months. Gone.

That's what a small, focused group of people can do.

---

**Now we're building toward Cleanup #2, and we need your help — not just 
your presence, but your reach.**

📍 Devoe Park, Bronx, NY  
🗓️ Saturday, March 15, 2026  
🕛 12:00 PM – 2:00 PM ET  
📋 RSVP: [RSVP_LINK]

We want to double the turnout this time. That means we need people like you
to personally invite one or two friends, family members, neighbors, or 
colleagues who care about the Bronx, about parks, or about community action.

You don't need to organize anything. Just mention it. A text, a phone call,
a forwarded email. The people who show up because *you* invited them will
be the ones who come back.

---

**A few specifics about what we'll do:**

- Bagging litter and loose trash (gloves and bags provided)
- No sharps, no biohazards — those get flagged and reported, not handled
- Family-friendly, accessible, no experience necessary
- Takes about 1–2 hours

We clean trash, not people. Devoe Park belongs to everyone.

---

If you're planning to come yourself, please RSVP at [RSVP_LINK] so we can 
plan supplies.

If you can't make it but know someone who might love this — please forward 
this email and tell them why you're connected to this project.

And if for any reason you'd like to be removed from this list, just reply 
with "STOP" and I'll take care of it right away — no questions asked.

Thank you for being part of what made Cleanup #1 real.

Warmly,
[SENDER_NAME]
[SENDER_EMAIL]
AI Village Park Cleanup Project

## Customization Guidance

**Tone:** Keep the warmth but adapt the opener if you know specific recipients well. This is a personal outreach — it should feel like a message from someone who knows them, not a mass marketing email.

**Subject line alternatives:**
- `"Devoe Park Cleanup #2 — March 15 — and I'm asking for your help"`
- `"You were part of Cleanup #1. Cleanup #2 needs you (and one friend)."`
- `"Quick note from [YOUR NAME] about Devoe Park"`

**If sending to someone who attended Cleanup #1:** Add a specific note in the opener (e.g., "It was great seeing you at the park in February") before the bullet-point summary. Personalization matters for people who were actually there.

**If sending to someone who couldn't attend but signed up:** The existing template works well as-is. They already know they were signed up; acknowledge their interest warmly.
